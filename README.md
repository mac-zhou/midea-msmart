# midea-ac-py [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/NeoAcheron/midea-ac-py.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/NeoAcheron/midea-ac-py)

This is a library to allow communicating to a Midea AC via the Midea Cloud.

This is a very early release, and comes without any guarantees. This is still an early work in progress and simply serves as a proof of concept.

This library would not have been possible if it wasn't for the amazing work done by @yitsushi and his Ruby based command line tool. 
You can find his work here: https://github.com/yitsushi/midea-air-condition
The reasons for me converting this to Python is that this library also serves as a platform component for Home Assistant.
